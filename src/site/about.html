                <p class="card-text">
                  We utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze
                  audio analyze deepfake detection. We utilize 5 models (which
                  you can find in our <a href="Credits.html">credits page</a>)
                  which each pass over a given audio file in both its original
                  form, as well an isolated sample of only vocals from the file.
                  For some of our models we have even trained twice, we use a
                  variant trained on original audio when we pass over the
                  original, and a model trained on isolated audio when we do the
                  vocal pass. The combination of these models allows us to
                  properly "fact check" results. Instead of relying on one model
                  to be perfect, we use multiple models that we finetune to
                  their best forms then weight them as part of a larger set.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We also care a lot about the problem of false positves, this
                  means Real audio classified incorrectly as Fake. This is a big
                  danger in AI as it leads to overuse of AI. Overuse of AI has
                  lead to implementation of AI in places that are at best
                  unnecessary and decreasing quality and suppliying misleading
                  information. We want to give the best results we can while
                  minimizing the risk of calling real sample fake, undermining
                  artists.

                  creation with much more relevant and diverse samples. Further
                  we trained each model twice, on isolated vocals and on
                  original audio resulting in two variants of each model. 3/5 of
                  our models showed improvement in their respective trained
                  category allowing us to use those specified trained variants
                  on the proper state of the audio (vocals / original â€“ backing
                  track and all). Two of our models performed strongly when
                  applied to both vocals and original, and the two separate
                  trains did not show signifcant differences leading us to use
                  the one best model for both audio forms.

                    This paper presents SoundScape, an innovatice approach to
                    deepfake audio detection, focusing on the music industry.
                    Our system uses vocal isolation to enhance detection
                    accuracy, separating vocals from backing tracks. This
                    improves input quality for our model, which utilizes various
                    deepfake detection programs, resulting in a more precise
                    analysis. Addressing the growing threat of deepfake media,
                    our solution protects artists and celebrities by verifying
                    audio authenticity. We offer a user-friendly web interface
                    for non-technical users to upload files, track their
                    analysis, and receive detailed results. Emphasizing
                    transparency, our model provides a percentage likelihood of
                    a deepfake and the reasoning behind it, reducing false
                    positive outputs. By continuously expanding our dataset and
                    retraining our AI model, we ensure effectiveness against the
                    best and latest deepfake methods. This paper explores
                    deepfake technology, its legal and ethical challenges, and
                    our proposed solution for detecting deepfake audio,
                    contributing to the ongoing debate of regulating and
                    mitigating deepfake risks.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-4 text-light">Results</h2>
        <div class="text-center">
          <p>
            In our evaluation we detect about 72% of deepfakes correctly, and
            83% of Real Audio correctly Classified. & 61% of Deepfake Audio
            correctly classified.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is important to us that we classify reals as correctly as
            possible. False positives are audio sample that we classify as
            DeepFake, but they are actually Real.
