npx http-server -p <port>
<port> being port of the site over localhost

i.e.

npx http-server -p 8000


IMPORTANT
---------

if you plan to run the api server on a port other than 8080 or an ip other than localhost then you need to change
js/global.js : line 1

let url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"

to correct ip and port. Again default in API server is http://127.0.0.1:8080
