                Our system is focused on deepfake music. As such our models have
                not been evaluated on accuracy against spoken DeepFakes. It is
                not recommended to use this software to detect spoken audio. The
                quality of spoken DeepFake detection models is far higher, and
                it is an area that massive tech companies have invested more
                resources than we could match in solving. Our focus is on music
                where fewer good solutions exist.

                No AI is perfect, we worked hard to make a system that is as
                accurate as possible. We strived to improve accuracy in an area
                of DeepFake detection that is under-research and with poor
                real-world results. Our performance is a great improvement, but
                nonetheless our results are never perfect. This is a tool to
                aide in detection and should not be treated as a whole solution.

                  No AI model is perfect. Right now the AI space is booming and
                  we are seeing every company rush to implement AI into their
                  products in some shape or form. Often this leads to useful
                  results, but we also are seeing how overuse of AI is degrading
                  the quality of existing products.

                  We include this page for transparency which we feel is lacking
                  in this space. Knowing that any AI software will not be
                  perfect, results from AI should always be fact checked. AI
                  currently cannot replace the efforts and need of humans within
                  almost any process.

                    AI is not perfect. We believe this needs to be more transparent to users in every application and industry. AI can be extremely useful, but it also can and has caused massive issues. AI is a tool, not a replacement for real research and work. We want users to approach AI with and understanding of the shortcomings, risks and understanding that AI information needs to be fact checked. AI is not a replacement for human work, it is a tool to aide and hopefully improve our work.
