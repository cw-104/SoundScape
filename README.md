# SoundScape

# How to run:

(Installation was tested on macos and linux ubuntu using python3.9, if you have a different OS additional steps or changing dependencies may be required)

## Requirements

- Install python3.9

1. clone the repo
2. cd SoundScape
3. create a venv for python3.9

```
python3.9 -m venv env
```

4. activate venv

```
source env/bin/activate
```

5. install dependencies

Per your operating system install
bzip2 libgmp-dev libblas-dev libffi-dev libgfortran5 libsqlite3-dev libz-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses5-dev libopenblas-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev tk-dev xz-utils

Macos

```
brew install bzip2 libgmp-dev libblas-dev libffi-dev libgfortran5 libsqlite3-dev libz-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses5-dev libopenblas-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev tk-dev xz-utils
```

Linux - apt

```
sudo apt install bzip2 libgmp-dev libblas-dev libffi-dev libgfortran5 libsqlite3-dev libz-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses5-dev libopenblas-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev tk-dev xz-utils libsox-dev
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Models

Most of the models are in the github, but there are a few you need to download

1. Trained XLSR
- waiting for google drive upload
This needs to be moved into src/trained_models

2. XLSR Wav2Vec dependency
you need to download xlsr2_300m.pt which is from wav2vec for xlsr to work
https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fairseq/wav2vec/xlsr2_300m.pt

this needs to be put into src/pretrained_models/XLS-R/xlsr2_300m.pt

3. install fairsec
```
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
pip install "pip<24.1" 
pip install "omegaconf<2.1"
pip install fairseq/ && rm -rf fairseq
```
fairseq may require some dependency resolution, typically the above resolutions works, but may vary

If it says
```
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
s3prl 0.4.17 requires omegaconf>=2.1.1, but you have omegaconf 2.0.6 which is incompatible.
```
Based on our testing, you should still be able to run with

```
py start_api.py
```

## Identification

you need to download the identification references from
- waiting for google drive upload

These should be in a folder
src/idenification_refrences
(inside the idenification_refrences/ folder should be folders of each artist name if you have an additional nested folder for some reason that must be removed)

## Run

API

```
cd src
py start_api.py
```

WEBSITE

```
cd src/site
npx http-server -p 8000
```
